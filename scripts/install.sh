# Script for installing the 'omnizart' command and the required packages.
#
# The script will first create a virtual environment, separating from the system's environment.
# There are two approaches for installing the 'omnizart' pacakage: poetry or pip. 
# The former relies on the third-party package 'poetry', and the latter is a built-in package.
# This script uses 'python -m venv .venv' to create the virutal environment for both
# installation approaches.
#
# After creating virtual env with venv, the script automatically installs the
# required packages and the 'omnizart' command in virtual env. As the installation
# finished, just activate the environment and enjoy~.
